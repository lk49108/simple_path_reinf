# simple_path_reinf

Project to solve NP hard problem of finding longest simple path in directed graph using reinforcement learning approach. At the moment Cross entropy algorithm is used. Additionally, at the moment we give a priori information to algorithm from which node the longest path starts (will be changed).

Neural network is used as a policy. State (input to the network) is binary (consists of 0's and 1's) of length 3*N, where N is number of nodes in the graph. First N digits of state are one-hot encoding of current node agent is in. Second batch of N digits has one-hot encoding of nodes that are reachable from current node agent is in. Third batch of N digits is one-hot encoding of what nodes are visited so far (in current session) by agent. Output of the agent (network) is probability distribution over what node should agent go to next.
